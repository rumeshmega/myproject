===========
Your INI-style Ansible inventory file appears to be mostly correct. However, there's a small issue with the ansible_ssh_private_key_file variable assignments where there should be a space after the equal sign. Here's the corrected version:

ini

[jenkins-master]
10.1.1.62

[jenkins-master:vars]
ansible_user = ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file = /opt/rum.ppk

[jenkins-slave]
10.1.1.120

[jenkins-slave:vars]
ansible_user = ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file = /opt/rum.ppk

I added spaces after the equal sign to separate the variable names from their values, which is the correct syntax in an INI-style inventory file. This corrected version should work as expected for specifying Ansible variables for your Jenkins master and slave hosts.

ChatGPT

The error message you're encountering, "Load key "/opt/rum.ppk": error in libcrypto\r\nubuntu@10.1.1.62: Permission denied (publickey)," indicates that Ansible is unable to establish an SSH connection to the target host 10.1.1.62 using the provided private key (/opt/rum.ppk). This error typically occurs when there's an issue with the SSH key or its format.

Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

    Check SSH Key Format: Ensure that the SSH key (/opt/rum.ppk) is in the correct format for use with OpenSSH. The .ppk format is used by PuTTY and needs to be converted to OpenSSH format. You can use puttygen to convert it:

    bash

puttygen /opt/rum.ppk -O private-openssh -o /opt/rum.pem

This command will convert the key to the OpenSSH format and save it as /opt/rum.pem. Make sure to use the new .pem key in your Ansible command.

SSH Key Permissions: Ensure that the permissions on the SSH key file (/opt/rum.pem) are set correctly. The file should be readable only by the owner. You can set the correct permissions using:

bash

chmod 600 /opt/rum.pem

Check Key Path: Verify that the path to the SSH key (/opt/rum.pem) is correctly specified in your Ansible inventory or command. Make sure there are no extra spaces or typos in the path.

SSH Agent: If you are using an SSH agent, ensure that the key is correctly added to the agent using ssh-add. Also, confirm that the SSH agent is running on the machine where you're executing Ansible.

bash

    eval $(ssh-agent -s)  # Start the SSH agent
    ssh-add /opt/rum.pem  # Add the key to the agent

    Host SSH Configuration: On the target host (10.1.1.62), make sure the SSH server is configured to allow key-based authentication (PasswordAuthentication no and PubkeyAuthentication yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config), and that the corresponding public key is added to the ~ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the ubuntu user.

    Verbose Mode: You can run Ansible in verbose mode using the -vvv option to get more detailed information about the SSH connection. This can help diagnose the issue further.

After performing these steps, try running your Ansible command again with the corrected key path (/opt/rum.pem) and ensure that the key is properly converted to OpenSSH format.
